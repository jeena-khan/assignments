This repository contains my assignments and practice work related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) using Python. Each file or notebook demonstrates concepts, algorithms, and techniques commonly used in AI/ML, ranging from foundational topics to more advanced implementations.

The goal of this repository is to organize my learning journey, provide well-structured solutions, and serve as a reference for others who are exploring AI and machine learning with Python.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute!
